## Getting started

The project was created using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and you can launch the project directory with the standard instructions:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework used
- [`react-router`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - Used to convert React into a multi-page web application
- [`react-helmet`](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) - Used to set the SEO settings (title tags, meta description, open graph images, etc.)
- [`react-snap`](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap) - Used to pre-render the web app into static HTML (increase page speeds and enables SEO)
- [`react-router-sitemap`](https://github.com/kuflash/react-router-sitemap) - Used to create an XML sitemap to improve SEO with better crawling
- [`react-gtm-module`](http://github.com/alinemorelli/react-gtm) - Used to install the Google Tag Manager container for website tracking

## Updating the sitemap
To update the sitemap, you need to manually add new routes to the `sitemap-routes.js` file.
